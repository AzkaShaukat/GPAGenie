# Process Model: Agile Scrum with Kanban Elements

## Chosen Methodology
We adopted a hybrid Agile approach combining:
- **Scrum** for structured iterations (3-days sprints)
- **Kanban** for continuous workflow visualization

## Key Practices
1. **Sprint Planning**: Bi-weekly planning sessions
2. **Daily Standups**: 15-minute sync meetings
3. **Visual Workflow**: Kanban board with columns:
   - Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Code Review → Testing → Done

## Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized feature list
- **Sprint Backlog**: Committed work items
- **Burndown Charts**: Track progress

## Justification
This hybrid approach provides:

✔️ Structure of Scrum  
✔️ Flexibility of Kanban  
✔️ Better visibility of WIP limits  
✔️ Adaptability to changing requirements
